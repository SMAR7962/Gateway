**Light Switch Assembly** 
First, contruct the Light box housing. Use the purchased would and the dimensions given in the lock files to cut out the needed pieces (6 total) 
Using the wood glue, assemble the the face, Wall H's, and wall V's. 
On the Plate, place one of the servo motors into the cut out slots. Use the cut out wooden U-brackets to fasten the motor and glue into place. 
While glue dries, fasten battery pack (filled with AA batteries), snuggly into the Face. 
Attach the 3D printed Light arm via sliding over prongs attached to motor head
Continue using the glue to attach two of the 3D printed hinges into the areas marked with an A on the plate. 
Glue the third into the areea marked B on the inside of the face box. When dried, take one of the bolts and feed it through the opennings, creating 
an arm for the hinges.  
Use the tape to hold the wires from the battery and motor together, and feed them through the opening 

**Lock Assembly** 
First, contruct the Lock box housing. Use the purchased would and the dimensions given in the lock files to cut out the needed pieces (6 total) 
Using the wood glue, assemble the the face, Wall H's, and wall V's. 
On the Plate, place one of the servo motors into the cut out slots. Glue into place so that the motor head will be caing towards the top of the box. 
Make sure that the arm is lined up with the slot cut into the H-wall 
Attach 3D printed Lock arm via 1.6mm screw through center slot
(Recommended it may be beneficial to begin wiring into the arduino before placing it into the box, this includes breadboard and lighting box)
Beneath the motor, attach the arduino nano. Fasten with either the double sided tape, or a small dab of glue. The pins should be facing into the box. 
Benath the Arduino attach the mini breadboard. 
Allow the wires for the RFID circuit to leave the box via the hole in the plate 
Face plate can now be friction fit onto the plate 

**RFID Assembly** 
Place RFID onto the RFID plate cut from the wood. It should fit directly over the pre cut prongs 
Tjhe wires from the Lock box can now be fed through the door and attached when ready 
Have the 3D printed face plate on standbye 

**Final Assembly** 
With all parts constructed, attach the light box to the rocker switch, and screw in the two 6-32 screws into the pre cut holes. They will line up 
directly with the holes in the rocker switch. 
Place the RFID on the opposite side of the dorr from the lock box. Feed the RFID wires through the hole in the dorr used for the lock. 
Attach and complete the circuit. 
From there, fir the lock box over the bolt lock so that the lock arm fits snugly over the head of the bolt. 
Line the box with the hole thorugh which the RFID wires are fed. Screw two 1-16 screws through the opennings by the whole on the plate 
Line the RFID on the other side so that the screws go through the same oriented holes. Tighten till both boxes fit snuggly against the door 
Lastly, Take 3D printed RFID box and fit over the RFID plate
