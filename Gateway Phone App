[Gateway](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/b/106u5). 

Short description of app creation:

To develop the Bluetooth app that controls the Gateway mechanisms, we used a program called "MIT App Inventor". 
The website uses simple design features such as drag and drop block coding to make a mobile app. 
After designing a clean interface, we used its Bluetooth connection code to pair the app and the HC-06 Bluetooth module in our device. 
The app has the capability to turn the lights on and off, as well as lock and unlock the door.
